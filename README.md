# Time-Series Forecasting of Household Energy Consumption on Edge Devices

This project focuses on building a time-series forecasting model using household energy consumption data and testing its performance under edge device constraints simulated with Docker.

## Project Goals
- Forecast household energy consumption using smart meter data
- Evaluate the model's performance on constrained environments (edge devices)
- Explore model optimization techniques (quantization, pruning, etc.)

## Folder Structure
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter/Colab notebooks for each phase
- `src/` - Modular Python scripts for data processing and model
- `data/` - Instructions or scripts to download dataset
- `models/` - Trained models
- `results/` - Visualizations and evaluation metrics
- `docker/` - Docker-related files for edge simulation

## Getting Started
Clone this repository and begin exploring the data using the notebooks provided in the `notebooks/` folder.
